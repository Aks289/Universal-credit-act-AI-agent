# Universal Credit Act 2025 – Mini AI Legal Analysis Agent

This project implements a mini AI agent that reads, summarises, and analyses the **Universal Credit Act 2025** and outputs a structured JSON report.  
It completes **Task 1 to Task 4** of the assignment:

1. **Extract text** from the Act PDF  
2. **Summarise** the entire Act in 5–10 bullet points  
3. **Extract key sections** (definitions, obligations, eligibility, penalties, etc.)  
4. **Evaluate the Act** against 6 rule-based legislative checks  

The system uses **Llama 3.3 70B** via the **Groq API** (fast and completely free).
